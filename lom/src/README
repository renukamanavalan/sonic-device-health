For any go test failure, grep for 
grep -e "^--- FAIL: "

This will give test function name and test.errorf statements

--- FAIL: TestHelper (0.00s)
    tx_test.go:762: FmtFprintf not called
    tx_test.go:773: FmtFprintf is called when not expected
    tx_test.go:781: FmtFprintf is called when not expected


Hint:
All funcs that start with Test (note: uppercase T) are run.
Pass "-v" in "go test" to set log level to verbose
When you are debugging, to help
s/^func Test/func XTest"
Now rename XTest to Test for one function at a time to help run one at a time.
