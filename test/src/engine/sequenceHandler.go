/*
 * Core functionality
 *
 *  1.  Raise requests for all actions right upon registration, that are first 
 *      in any sequence. This is mostly anomaly detection.
 *  
 *  2.  Track all active requests.
 *  
 *  3.  Upon response from first action create sequence, if all actions of that
 *      sequence are registered.
 *  
 *  4.  Send requests with timeout to rest of the actions in sequence, provided
 *      the response of last called is good.
 *
 *  5.  Upon completion of processing all actions, the sequence is removed
 *
 *  Note:
 *      a.  Every action response is published with constraints.
 *      b.  First action of the sequence is published with state='init' and upon
 *          sequence completion, it is re-publsihed with state="complete" and
 *          appropriate result code.
 *
 *  Failure scenarios:
 *  A.  Sequence config could be missing data, like action w/o config, the sequence
 *      config is removed, one or more actions in the sequence is marked 'disabled'
 *      and more
 *  
 *  B.  An action in the sequence could have failed result_code != 0
 *
 *  C.  Request or sequence could have timedout
 *
 *  D.  Any other fatal failure ?
 *
 *  On any failure:
 *      i.  Seq is processed as complete with possible error codes
 *      ii. TODO: Honor *mandatory* flag, as call

 * NOTE: Only one outstanding request per Action
 *       Hence can be keyed off by action.
 *
 * NOTE: Engine may abort a sequence when its current request does not
 *       respond within its timeout. But it does *not* remove request from
 *       the active list, until the action/client sends the response. This
 *       is because, it implies that the plugin/action is still busy with
 *       last given request and we can't raise another request, as there 
 *       can be atmost one active request per action.
 *
 *       In case of any fatal failure, a de-register action/client or 
 *       re-register by client will drop the requests associated with 
 *       de-registered actions.

/*
 * Sequence is kicked off when first request of a sequence responds.
 *
 * There can be many sequences. But only one sequence can be active.
 *
 * SequenceInfo and related data is read & filled upon sequence creation
 * which is when the first action of the sequence responds.
 * 
 * Only one sequence can be active. Any sequence created when one is active
 * is added to pending Q. Going active implies invoking other actions of the
 * sequence, sequentially. Sequence remains active until all actions of the
 * sequence are complete or timeout, whichever comes earlier.
 *
 * When there are multiple sequences ready to go active, they are first sorted
 * by Priority and then by order of arrival within same priority
 *
 * All sequences have timeout. Some sequence may timeout, even before going 
 * active.
